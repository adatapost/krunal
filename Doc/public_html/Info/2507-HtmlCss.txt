Important : File and folder created under "TOMCAT_HOME/webapps" are
	    case-sensitive so becareful while naming files/folder.             Always keep lower-case filename.

            Index.html  is completely different than index.html


HTML (HyperText Markup Language) 
================================

It is web-standard to present data on web. HTML is a "standard" recommended by World Wide Web Consortium - w3c.org or w3.org. At W3, industry experts discuss & define standards and software companies and tutors and students (educators) adopt these standards.


Currently W3 working on HTML5 standard (HTML3 , HTML4 and XHTML standards are also used and will be used forever).


There is another standard called "XML - eXtensible Markup Language" to describe data for programs/applications. That's why XML is called "data-interchange" format/protocol.

Both, HTML & XML (and other) standards are derived from SGML - Standard Generized Markup Language.

What is a markup?

   It is a way to seperate things by surrounding pair of symbols (tags)    which sementically describe the things more effectively.
  
  e.g

   <header>Malesian Air plane crashes</header>
   <section>
         something happens on <time format="yy-mm-dd">2010-10-21 10:10:20 PM</time>
         at <em>ABC Airport</em>.

   </section>
   <footer><em>compiled by <strong>Mr.A</strong></em> on <time>2010--   </time></footer>     

What is <!doctype html>
-------------------------

Each webpage must begins with <!doctype html>. If it is missed then you're in trouble.

<!doctype html> is an instruction for web-browser to parse & render HTML markup in "standard Mode". If this directive is not found then web-browser parse & render HTML arbitry because in that case web-browser will be entered into "quirk or dirty mode".


1. <html lang="en_US">  -- Always specify the page language.
   <html lang="hi_IN">
               en
               hi

   Search engine will classify pages based upon language.

2. <head> used for:

      1. To instruct the web-browser and access some of browser's
         features 1) title 2) page cache
      2. To embed resources (files -- css, js and other files)
      3. To instruct the search engine about page and its purpose.

      
    Important: Cascade stylesheet resources (files) should be
               glued (linked) under <head> section but
               Javascript resources must appear just before the
               close of </body> tag.

              That way web-browser render the content without blocking.

  e.g

     ...
     <head>
        ....
        <script src="file.js"></script>
        ...
     </head>
        <h1>Hello</h1> <---- This will appear after loading "file.js"
			     so if web-browser take 40 seconds to load
				then Hello will be displayed after 40 
				seconds.

				So here, Javascript loading will block
				the rendering of HTML.

Best practice:

 ...
 <head>
  ....
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/style.css"/>
  ....
 </head>
 <body>
    .....
    .....
    
    <!-- Javascript code  (This is HTML comment) -->
    <script src="js/sample.js"></script>
    <script>
         //javascript code
    </script>
  </body>


OR better use "async" attribute (or differ attribute) to load external Javascript resources concurrently (threaded).

    <script src="js/sample.js" async  onload="doInit()"></script>
    <script>
         function doInit() {
             //code
          }
    </script>
