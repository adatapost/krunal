Java EE
====================================================
  
  Java EE is a platform to develop & deploy enterprize   applications.

  To develop and deploy Java EE apps, we must have Java EE
  application server. [Apache-Tomcat, GlassFish, JBoss, WebLogic   Bea are example of Java EE application Server].

  Application server might have one or more "containers" to   deploy different types of applications.

  These containers can be :
  
        1. Web Container - To host Java EE web app
   
        2. EJB Container - To host Java EE Enterprize Java Beans
			   applications.

        3. Applet & application Container - To host client 				applications.

 
  Applications (Web,EJB or client-App) created and bundled as per
  Java SE, and EE standard.

    Client applications, and libraries are bundled in a .jar     file. (Java Archieve)

    Web applications are bundled into .war (Web Archieve)

    Enterprize apps are bundled into .ear (Enterprize Archieve)


   In netbeans or eclipse, you just need to "build" menu option
   to create .jar, .war or .ear.


   Once you create a bundle or distribution copy of your    application, you just drop it into "container's" auto-deploy
   folder or use container's application deploy features    (configuration).


   The Web Container and web application directory structure
  ===========================================================

  Java EE Web application must follow following directory
  structure strictly.

  /webapp/  <------ This is your context
         |
         |
         |-----/META-INF/      <-- Must be in upper-letter
                        manifest 
                        context files.
         |              [This folder contains instructions for
         |               Java EE app server about application]
         |
         |----/WEB-INF/    <--- Must be in upper-letter
                      |
                      |
                      |-----/classes/     Compiled .class files
                      |
                      |-----/lib/         .jar files
                      |
                      |-----/other_private_folders/

                      [Files/Folder created inside the WEB-INF
		       or META-INF are protected by the 
		      application server and they are not 
		      visible to public user/machine.
         |
         |
         | - index.jsp and other public files
         | - public folders for "css", "js", "images", etc.


    Java EE Web app directory structure is case-sensitive. Any     type of file(image, css, js, html) or program you add into
    the application must be accessed via the exact "filename" or     "foldername" or "program name".

         
    The Deployment Descriptor File - /WEB-INF/web.xml
   ===========================================================
    The web.xml file contains application configuration settings
    through which we call instructs/tells the application
    server about the need to our application, configure &     registration of servlets and filter classes, set     authentication (login) and many more things.

    Each web-app must have a deployment descriptor (web.xml)     file.

    Sample of web.xml file 
    -----------------------

     <web-app>
         ......
     </web-app>

     Elements in web.xml are case-sensitive and they must be
     strictly nested. The root element name of web.xml must be
     <web-app>.
