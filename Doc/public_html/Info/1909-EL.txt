 EL - Expression Language 
 ==============================================================

 Expression Language is part of JSP Specification and it is used
 to read value / data from the scoped objects -  pageContext,request, session and application. Note that the EL  cannot update / modify the data of scoped object.

 The power of EL lie in its coresion feature - It convert all objects to "string", all null to "empty string", all number without decimal point to long and all number with decimal to double automatically.

 EL is a simple expression language which support arithmetic, relational, logical, teranary and other operators and it is used by other Java EE viewEngines and Java Server Pages Standard Tag Library (JSTL).

  Syntax
  ========

    ${expr}

 e.g

   ${10+20} will result 30

  Where "expr" must be literal (constant) or key of scoped object   and property of an object that is added into scoped object.

  
Example: Compare write method of Scriptlet with ${el-expr}.

<%
 pageContext.setAttribute("message", "Hello");
 String message = (String) pageContext.getAttribute("message");
 if(message !=null){
    out.println(message.length());
 }
%>    
<br/>${10}
<br/>${10+20}
<br/>${10>20}
<br/>Message: ${message}
<br/>Message: ${message.length()}  <-- Wont throws an exception
					when message not exists.


So EL ${expr} is the replacement of "out.println or out.print" and "<%=expr%>". So in future, we will never use scriptlets or expression tag in our JSP.

In fact, we don't need Scriptlet, Expression and Declaration tag when we will learn "JSTL" along with EL.

In which order, the scoped object is read by the EL?

  Firstly, it looks up "pageContext" for the key and if it is   found then read it and stops. 
  
  If key is not exists in "pageContext" then goes to   "requestScope" and reads value if it is exists.

  if key is not in "requestScope" then looks up into   "sessionScope" and reads if it is exists.

  if key is not in "sessionScope" then looks up into "applicationScope" and read if it is exists.

   And finally if key is not exists in all four scope then
   returns empty string.

Example: (Note: Remove/add comment and see what happens?)

<%
    int n1=10;
    //pageContext.setAttribute("no", n1);
    //request.setAttribute("no", 100);
    //session.setAttribute("no", 1000);
    application.setAttribute("no", 10000);
%>    
${no} 


  EL Implicit objects
  ----------------------------------------------------------

   Four scoped objects in EL are referenced via : pageScope, requestScope, sessionScope and applicationScope.

Example:

<%
    int n1=10;
    pageContext.setAttribute("no", n1);
    request.setAttribute("no", 100);
    session.setAttribute("no", 1000);
    application.setAttribute("no", 10000);
%>    
<br/> - Page but not obvious - ${no} 
<br/> - Page - ${pageScope.no} 
<br/> - Request - ${requestScope.no} 
<br/> - Session - ${sessionScope.no} 
<br/> - Application - ${applicationScope.no}
