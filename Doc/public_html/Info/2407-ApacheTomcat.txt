Apache-Tomcat Java EE Application Server
=====================================================================

 Application server is a software which hosts applications/software and  manage memory, resources, compilation and execution of hosted  applications.


 In other words, application server is a "container" of applications.

 There are number of application server exists but those who implements  Java EE specifications are called "Java EE Application Servers".


 List of Java EE application servers:

    1. Apache Tomcat from Apache Foundation (open source)
    2. Glassfish from oracle (open source & commercial)
    3. WebSphere from IBM
    4. WebLogic Bea from IBM
    5. JBoss from JBoss and many other vendors specific app servers.


Install & Config the Apache Tomcat 
---------------------------------

1. Run with admin privileges
2. Select Full + Set Http port : 8084 
3. admin user : admin
       pass   : admin

4. Choose "destination folder" e.g x:\Tomcat8.0 (Do not use default    path)
5. Open "Tomcat Monitor" with admin privi to start/stop application 
   server.


  After starting app server, open web-browser and type   http://localhost:8084 url at addressbar.


Create Java EE web application and host/install it in app server.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Open Apache Tomcat Home (x:\Tomcat8.0)
2. Open "webapps" -- is called automatic deployment folder
3. create a folder in "webapps" (say 'dhavan')
4. open 'dhavan' folder and add

    index.html (index.htm) file with following content


 index.html
-------------
  <!doctype html>

   <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8"/>
        <title>Welcome</title>
      </head>
      <body>
         <h1>Welcome to Java EE Application server</h1>
         <h2>We are using <strong>Apache Tomcat <em>Application</em>
             server</strong></h2>
         <h3>The name of my application is <strong>dhavan</strong></h3>
         <hr/>
         <div>
            All kind of services for my application <code>dhavan</code>
            will be provided by the <code>Application service</code>.
         </div>
       </body>
     </html>

5. Open web-browser with http://localhost:8084/dhavan

   The application server looks for "index.xxxx" file and if it is    found then server it (copy it to web-browser).

   http://localhost:8084/dhavan


is equivalent to

   http://localhost:8084/dhavan/index.html



   You can choose .jsp extension to embed Java code into web-pages.

   Use <% .... %> scriplet tag to embed Java code.

 index.jsp
 ---------

 <!doctype html>

 <%
   String title = "Welcome";
   String appServer = "Apache Tomcat 8.0";
   String appName = "dhavan";
 %>

 <html lang="en">
    <head>
       <meta charset="utf-8"/>
       <title><%=title%></title>
    </head>
    <body>
       <ul>
          <li>Application Server : <%=appServer%></li>   
          <li>Application  : <%=appName%></li>
        </ul>
     </body>
  </html>

  <%=expression%> - is called expression tag to write data from   variable or literal at which it is used/embed.

Example - sample1.jsp
----------------------
<!doctype html>

<%
  java.util.Date dt = new java.util.Date();
%>

<p>Today <%=dt%></p>
