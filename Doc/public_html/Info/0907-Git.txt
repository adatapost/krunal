 About Git
 =========

 The Github is (public/free) code repository. You can push (upload), pull (download), commit (confirm changes) 
 First of all you don't have account in order to read & download the  public repository.

 If you register to github.com then you can copy existing public repository (called fork), make changes, commit,
 push or pull as per your will. Your local work in your location can be sync with github.com's   repository but to 
 do so you need to setup the local git repository.
